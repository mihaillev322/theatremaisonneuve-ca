<summary>What is the difference between a food pantry and a food bank?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>A food bank is typically a regional warehouse and distribution hub that sources food at scale and supplies partner agencies. A food pantry is a local distribution point that provides food directly to households. In pantry operations, the pantry may receive food from a food bank, retailers, farms, or community drives. The distinction matters in food pantry planning because storage capacity, reporting requirements, and ordering systems often differ.</p>

<summary>How do we choose between client-choice and pre-packed distribution?</summary>
<div class="faq-answer">
<p>Client-choice can improve dignity and reduce waste because households select items they will use. Pre-packed boxes can reduce decision time and simplify inventory, which may help when volunteer capacity is limited. Many US programs use a hybrid model. In community food access planning, the best choice depends on space, staffing, and the predictability of supply.</p>

<p>Beyond the questions above, coordinators often ask about volunteer management, insurance, and technology. While these topics vary significantly by location and organizational structure, a few general principles apply. Volunteer training should cover food safety, client interaction, and emergency procedures. Insurance requirements depend on the host organization and local regulations; consult with your fiscal sponsor or legal advisor. Technology choices should prioritize simplicity: a paper sign-in sheet may be more reliable than a tablet app if internet access is inconsistent.</p>
<p>For detailed guidance on federal nutrition programs, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service provides official resources. The CDC offers food safety training materials suitable for volunteer orientation. These external sources are authoritative and regularly updated.</p>
