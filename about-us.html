<h1>About Civic Pantry Atlas and our editorial method</h1>
</header>
<section id="mission" aria-labelledby="mission-heading">
<h2 id="mission-heading">Purpose and audience</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Atlas exists to make food pantry planning easier to understand for US coordinators, volunteers, partner organizations, and local stakeholders. The site focuses on pantry operations that affect day-to-day reliability: distribution models, safety routines, scheduling, and basic measurement. It is not a fundraising platform and does not publish individual pantry listings. Instead, it provides a neutral framework that teams can adapt to local conditions.</p>
<p>The writing tone is intentionally objective. When there are multiple valid approaches, the site describes tradeoffs rather than prescribing a single method. When a topic depends on local regulation, the site points readers to authoritative agencies and encourages confirmation with local health departments or program administrators.</p>
</section>
<section id="sources" aria-labelledby="sources-heading">
<h2 id="sources-heading">Sources and verification</h2>
<p>The site prioritizes public, authoritative references for US community food access. These include federal agencies, public health guidance, and established nonprofit research. When summarizing guidance, the site aims to preserve the original meaning and avoids adding requirements that are not present in the source.</p>
<p>External authority links used as reference points include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.usda.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">USDA</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Feeding America</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If a statement is time-sensitive, the site frames it as a general practice and encourages readers to check the latest official updates.</p>
</section>
<section id="accessibility" aria-labelledby="accessibility-heading">
<h2 id="accessibility-heading">Accessibility and performance choices</h2>
<p>Civic Pantry Atlas is designed as a static site with no scripts and no images. This reduces load time and improves compatibility with assistive technologies and older devices. The layout uses semantic HTML5 landmarks so screen readers can navigate by region. Typography and spacing follow a Swiss typography approach: clear hierarchy, consistent rhythm, and restrained color.</p>
<p>The CSS includes focus-visible styles for keyboard navigation, high-contrast text on a light background, and responsive layout rules for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Motion is minimized and respects user preferences through prefers-reduced-motion.</p>
</section>
<section id="editorial" aria-labelledby="editorial-heading">
<h2 id="editorial-heading">Editorial standards and updates</h2>
<p>Updates are handled conservatively. The site favors stable concepts in pantry operations rather than short-lived trends. When new guidance affects food safety or program administration, the site can be revised to reflect the change and to link to the official announcement.</p>
<p>To keep food pantry planning content consistent, the site uses a small controlled vocabulary: food pantry planning, community food access, and pantry operations. These phrases appear across pages at a natural rate to support search clarity without keyword stuffing.</p>
</section>
<section id="table" aria-labelledby="table-heading">
